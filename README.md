Sharing datasets and resources for machine learning in hopes they can be useful to experienced folk and newbies alike. To start off here are some I have found useful over the past year:
.
.
Google Resources
colab.research.google.com - Google Colab Free Jupyter Notebooks and GPUs - great for sharing and training. spun up resources only last for 12 hours though.
https://research.google.com/seedbank/seeds - Collection of Interactive Machine Learning Examples and Open Sourced Research
https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/ - ML Rules Guide for ML Projects
.
.
Research Paper Sites
http://www.arxiv-sanity.com/ - Developed by Andrej Karpathy (Tesla Director of AI) - Nice concise display of the latest research papers in ML and AI. Much better than arxiv.
https://openai.com/research/#publications - Research done by OpenAI
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/research-area/artificial-intelligence/publications/ - Microsoft Research Publications
.
.
Datasets
The OG - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php
Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets
Great List of datasets - https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/the-50-best-public-datasets-for-machine-learning-d80e9f030279
.
.
Conference Videos
http://scaledml.org/2019/ - Scaled ML - can see all previous years talks. Great speakers like Andrej Karpathy, Jeff Dean, Yangqing Jia, Francois Chollet, etc.
https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SPW2018/DLS/# - Deep Learning and Security Workshop
.
.
Training Curriculum - All Practical based
fast.ai - free, and very good.
machinelearningmastery.com - Jason Brownlee does a great job breaking down the latest algorithms and model implementations. His guides are excellent as well.
https://aws.amazon.com/training/learning-paths/machine-learning/
https://www.deeplearning.ai/ - Andrew Ng is amazing.
https://www.udacity.com/school-of-ai - great but the most expensive of this list.
https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning
also the deep learning specialization
https://www.dataquest.io/ - $33.25/month
https://www.datacamp.com/ - $29/month
.
.
GitHub Pages 
Facebook Research - https://github.com/facebookresearch
OpenAI - https://github.com/openai
OpenAI Gym is great for reinforcement learning.
UPenn Research Lab - https://github.com/EpistasisLab
ML Cheatsheet - https://github.com/bfortuner/ml-cheatsheet
Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Code - https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning
Good Character Level Language Model in Tensorflow - https://github.com/sherjilozair/char-rnn-tensorflow
